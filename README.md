## Hi there, I'm Sarmad 
**Data Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer**

I'm a Data Engineer at **Adept Tech Solutions** where I work on building distributed data pipelines, FastAPI microservices, and synthetic data generation systems.  
Previously, I worked in **Analog & Mixed Signal IC Design** where I have designed components like SAR ADCs, comparators, RFID Transponder Chips.

### Research
**Optimizing Resource Allocation in MEC-Enabled CR-NOMA Networks using Deep Reinforcement Learning**  
*Published at IEEE WCNC 2024 (Wireless Communications and Networking Conference).*


This paper introduces an RL-driven framework where an energy-harvesting IoT device offloads computation to a nearby MEC server using CR-NOMA transmission.  
A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent dynamically allocates time between:

- Data transmission  
- Energy harvesting  
- Local processing  

to **minimize service delay** while maintaining energy sustainability.
