## Hi there, I'm Sarmad 
**Data Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer**

I'm a Data Engineer at **ASCEND Synthetic Data Platform** where I work on building distributed data pipelines, FastAPI microservices, and synthetic data generation systems.  
Previously, I worked in **Analog & Mixed Signal IC Design** where I have designed components like SAR ADCs, comparators, RFID Transponder Chips.
